# Project Name
Local Movie Library


## Description
DURATION: Weekend Sprint


With Local Movie Library we are now able to access and individually view movies that are stored in our database. Upon page load our users may scroll through a list of movies displayed with a visual and corresponding movie title. In addition, users are able to actually add a movie to the list by visiting our 'Add Movie' page. This movie will then display in a list with the previously listed movies.
